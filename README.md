# ublock-filters
Some filters to make websites useable that I find annoying or ugly because of ads and stuff

My suggestion is to use a script blocker like umatrix oder noscript, 
so you can control every connection that is made (or not haha).

Firefox:
https://addons.mozilla.org/de/firefox/addon/umatrix/ - uMatrix (Should be by Raymond Hill or gorhill)
https://addons.mozilla.org/de/firefox/addon/noscript/ - NoScript

Chrome:
https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/umatrix/ogfcmafjalglgifnmanfmnieipoejdcf - uMatrix (Should be by Raymond Hill or gorhill)
https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/noscript/doojmbjmlfjjnbmnoijecmcbfeoakpjm - NoScript
